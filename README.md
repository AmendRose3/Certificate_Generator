# Certificate Generator Web App

A simple Flask-based web application that allows users to generate personalized certificates by uploading a CSV file. The app processes the CSV data and creates certificates from a predefined template, then compresses them into a downloadable ZIP file.

## Features

- Upload a CSV file with columns: `Name`, `College Name`, `Event`, and `Rank`.
- Automatically generates certificates for each entry.
- Personalized certificates with the user's name, college, event, and rank (if applicable).
- Download all generated certificates as a ZIP file.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Web framework to handle file uploads and serve the app.
- **Pandas**: For reading and processing the CSV data.
- **Pillow**: For creating and manipulating certificate images.
- **Zipfile**: To create a downloadable ZIP file of certificates.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/certificate-generator.git
   cd certificate-generator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Ensure you have the following files in your project folder**:
   - `certificate_template.png`: The certificate template image.
   - `arial.ttf`: Font file for rendering text on the certificates.
   - `certificates.csv`: A CSV file containing the data for certificate generation (sample provided below).

4. **Run the Flask app**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
